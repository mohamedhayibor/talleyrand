###### Mainly did it to experiment with MongoDB. All data is stored remotely using Mongolab. I wanted to build a full inventory system but I am still working on a project coded spretzzatura. Give a shot, maybe using React and bootstrap dashboard template. I might tackle it next week.

Anyways if you're running the program:
```
1. Get your own account and api (given by default): https://mongolab.com
2. git clone https://github.com/mohamedhayibor/talleyrand.git
3. Insert the Api key on js/main.js
4. Bend, mess with it
```
> Make sure that you set up your database (db) read only setting to "false"

You will need 2 collections for your db: (I chose)
```
1- discounts
2- aisles
```
> If blocked on anything, just check out: http://docs.mongolab.com/data-api/


> Fun fact 25% deep into the project, I realized that using React would've been a bit more productive due to the amount of HTML.
